# RMF Schedule ROS2 Node
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:cnboonhan94/fleet-adapter-tutorial.git -b 04-schedule-node`

This chapter introduces the ROS2 RMF Schedule Node. This is an implementation of the RMF Schedule as described in [03-rmf-core-overview](https://github.com/cnboonhan94/fleet-adapter-tutorial/tree/03-rmf-core-overview). For this chapter, the Schedule will be empty. Following this, a fleet adapter ( implemented uniquely for each individual fleet ) will update the Schedule through ROS2 *service calls*.

## Building the Schedule Node
* Source your ROS2 Distro
* `cd ros2`
* `colcon build --packages-up-to rmf_traffic_schedule`
* `source install/setup.bash`
* `ros2 run rmf_traffic_schedule run_schedule`

Now, open another ROS2 terminal and `ros2 topic list`. You will see the new topic:
```
/rmf_traffic/mirror_wakeup
```
Now run `ros2 service list`. You will see the following services:
```
/rmf_traffic/erase_schedule
/rmf_traffic/mirror_update
/rmf_traffic/register_query
/rmf_traffic/submit_trajectory
/rmf_traffic/unregister_query
/rmf_traffic_schedule_node/describe_parameters
/rmf_traffic_schedule_node/get_parameter_types
/rmf_traffic_schedule_node/get_parameters
/rmf_traffic_schedule_node/list_parameters
/rmf_traffic_schedule_node/set_parameters
/rmf_traffic_schedule_node/set_parameters_atomically
```

## Understanding the Schedule Node
Recall that the Schedule captures information about other fleets in the environment as a Database of Trajectories. Also recall that there are Mirrors, which act as local copies of the main Schedule's Database. Now, lets analyse the above services and topics.

### /rmf_traffic/mirror_wakeup
This is the only topic publishing [MirrorWakeup.msg](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_core/blob/traffic_msgs/rmf_traffic_msgs/msg/MirrorWakeup.msg). The Schedule will periodically publish MirrorWakeup.msg to downstream Mirrors, which will then trigger a `mirror_update` service.

### Services
Reading the service names should give a good idea of what they do. Refer [here](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_core/tree/traffic_msgs/rmf_traffic_msgs/srv) for service message details, APIs and what to expect as responses.
